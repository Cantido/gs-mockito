= Retrofitting for Mockito

[partintro]
--
Writing branch new code along with its unit tests is a great way to get familiar with the common ways of mocking and dependency injection.
You can exercise that knowledge and challenge yourself by writing unit tests for code that previously did not have it.
It's an unfortunate fact that in most cases you can't just write unit tests without modifying production code.
This part of the guide will cover strategies and refactorings that I've found very helpful while writing tests for existing code.

This part will be structured around certain problems that make dependency injection and isolated testing difficult, followed by strategies to circumvent or resolve the problem.
