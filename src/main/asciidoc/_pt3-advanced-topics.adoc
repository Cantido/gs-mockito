Mockito provides advanced features that, while not often used, can be a lifesaver in cases where you just can't pull apart a class enough to test.
If you've written the production code alongside your tests, it is unlikely that you'll need some of these advanced features, but they can dramatically decrease the amount of code you have to write in order to test certain kinds of functionality.

This part of the guide will cover several features of Mockito that go beyond the creation of mocks and stubbing of methods.
